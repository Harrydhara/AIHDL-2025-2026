# OpenROAD Setup and Documentation

OpenROAD is an open-source tool chain for physical chip design with a fully autonomous, 24-hour layout implementation.

## Installation

### From Source (Linux/macOS)
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD.git
cd OpenROAD
./etc/DependencyInstaller.sh
./etc/Build.sh
```

### Using Package Managers

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openroad
```

#### macOS
```bash
brew install openroad
```

## Basic Usage

### GUI Mode
```bash
openroad -gui
```

### Command Line
```bash
openroad -no_gui script.tcl
```

### Basic Flow Script
```tcl
# Read design
read_lef technology.lef
read_def design.def

# Floorplan
initialize_floorplan -utilization 70 -aspect_ratio 1 -core_space 2

# Placement
global_placement
detailed_placement

# Routing
global_route
detailed_route

# Write results
write_def final_design.def
```

## AI-HDL Integration

### For Design Phase 2 & 3
- Physical implementation
- PPA optimization
- Advanced placement and routing

### Key Features for Competition
- **Timing-driven placement**
- **Congestion-aware routing**
- **Power optimization**
- **Area minimization**

## Design Flow Components

### 1. Floorplanning
```tcl
initialize_floorplan -utilization 80 -aspect_ratio 1.0
```

### 2. Power Grid
```tcl
pdngen
```

### 3. Placement
```tcl
global_placement -timing_driven
detailed_placement
```

### 4. Clock Tree Synthesis
```tcl
clock_tree_synthesis -buf_list $buf_list
```

### 5. Routing
```tcl
global_route
detailed_route
```

## Performance Optimization

### Timing Optimization
- Critical path analysis
- Buffer insertion
- Gate sizing

### Area Optimization
- High-density placement
- Via minimization
- Wire length optimization

### Power Optimization
- Clock gating
- Power grid optimization
- Dynamic power reduction
