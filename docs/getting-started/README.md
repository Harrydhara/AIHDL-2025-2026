## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our pre-configured Docker container:

```bash
# Pull and run the container
docker pull aihdl/competition-env:2025
docker run --rm -it aihdl/competition-env:2025

# Run with your workspace mounted
docker run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/my-aihdl-workspace":/home/student/workspace \

## üß™ Tutorial Challenge

Complete our hands-on tutorial to verify your setup:

### Step 1: Environment Test
```bash
# In your AI-HDL environment
cd ~/examples/basic_modules

# Compile and simulate
iverilog -o and_gate and_gate.v and_gate_tb.v
./and_gate

# View waveforms
gtkwave and_gate.vcd
```

### Step 2: AI Integration Test
```bash
# Test AI logging utility
python3 ~/tools/python/aihdl/logger.py demo

# Check the generated log
cat ai-logs/conversation_*.md
```

### Step 3: Simple Design Challenge
Create a 4-bit adder using AI assistance:

1. **Prompt an LLM**: "Create a Verilog module for a 4-bit binary adder with carry-in and carry-out"
2. **Save the code** to `adder_4bit.v`
3. **Create a testbench** (also with AI help)
4. **Simulate and verify** the design
5. **Log your AI interactions**
