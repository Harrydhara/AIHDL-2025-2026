- **Complexity:** Low to medium.  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Buffer management to avoid overflow.  
  - Baud rate control for timing accuracy.  
  - Add enable/disable logic to save power.  


### 2. SPI or I¬≤C Controller
- **Purpose:** Interfaces with off-chip devices like sensors or EEPROMs.  
- **Benefits:** Realistic SoC peripheral; enables expansion.  
- **Complexity:** Medium.  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Mode selection (master/slave, fast/slow).  
  - Arbitration logic (for I¬≤C).  
  - Protect against glitch attacks or unintended bus driving.  

### 3. PWM Generator / Timer
- **Purpose:** Produces periodic signals for motor control, LEDs, etc.  
- **Benefits:** Tests timer and interrupt logic.  
- **Complexity:** Simple logic.  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Avoid counter overflow bugs.  
  - Clock gating when idle.  
  - Use watchdog features to prevent runaway states.  


### 4. AES / Crypto Accelerator
- **Purpose:** Hardware block for encryption/decryption.  
- **Benefits:** Great for security-oriented teams; demonstrates hardware acceleration.  
- **Complexity:** Medium to high.  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Constant-time implementation to resist side-channels.  
  - Manage power overhead (crypto engines are expensive).  
  - Integrate with memory-mapped registers.  


### 5. CRC / Checksum Unit
- **Purpose:** Computes cyclic redundancy check for data validation.  
- **Benefits:** Lightweight but widely used in communication protocols.  
- **Complexity:** Medium.  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Add fault injection tests.  
  - Ensure polynomial logic is parameterizable.  
  - Document error coverage rates.  


### 6. DMA Controller
- **Purpose:** Automates data transfers between memory and peripherals.  
- **Benefits:** Adds realism to SoC flow; useful in performance evaluation.  
- **Complexity:** High (requires bus arbitration).  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Memory protection (avoid overwriting critical regions).  
  - Ensure correctness under simultaneous transfers.  
  - Add a simple priority mechanism.  


### 7. GPIO Controller / Expander
- **Purpose:** Provides general-purpose I/O pins.  
- **Benefits:** Easy to test and expand functionality.  
- **Complexity:** Low.  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Input debouncing for switches.  
  - Output protection to avoid short-circuits.  
  - Restrict access to sensitive pins.  


### 8. Watchdog Timer

- **Benefits:** Classic embedded feature, introduces reliability.  
- **Complexity:** Low.  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Ensure it cannot be disabled maliciously.  
  - Document timeout programming model.  
  - Optimize area for minimal overhead.  


### 9. FIFO / Queue Buffer
- **Purpose:** Buffers data between producer and consumer.  
- **Benefits:** Tests handshakes and backpressure.  
- **Complexity:** Medium.  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Protect against overflow/underflow.  
  - Ensure back-to-back transfer performance.  
  - Verify with corner-case stress tests.  


### 10. Interrupt Controller
- **Purpose:** Manages and prioritizes multiple interrupt sources.  
- **Benefits:** Adds system realism; teaches interrupt handling.  
- **Complexity:** Medium.  
- **Considerations:**  
  - Secure masking/unmasking of interrupts.  
  - Prevent privilege escalation through spurious interrupts.  
  - Ensure deterministic latency.  


‚úÖ **Guidance for Teams**  
- Start with **simple peripherals** (GPIO, Timer, FIFO) if new to RTL design.  
- Attempt **complex ones** (DMA, Crypto, Interrupt Controller) for innovation and higher competition scoring.
